                Known as Isola di Spezie under Venetian rule and Pityoussa (pine-clad) in ancient times, Spetses, at just 54 nautical miles from Athens, is a picturesque, car-free island with a unique architecture, naval history and culture. The island flourished during the early 18th century, developing into a significant naval power, dominating the major shipping routes of the Mediterranean. Today, the two-hundred year old captains’ mansions lining the coast are testimony to the vast wealth and grandeur of that time. The mansion of the Greek War of Independence heroine Laskarina Bouboulina – the only female admiral in world naval history - now houses Bouboulina’s Museum which hosts a Cultural Festival every summer with a plethora of events - while the Spetses State Museum is housed in the mansion of Spetsiot revolutionary leader Hatziyannis Mexis and contains artefacts representing more than 4000 years of history.
